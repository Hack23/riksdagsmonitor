### Swedish FOI System
**Offentlighetsprincipen** (Constitutional right to access public documents):

- No need to explain why you want documents
- Response required "immediately" (typically within days)
- Appeals to Parliamentary Ombudsman if denied
- Covers Riksdag, Government, Myndigheter (agencies)

**Protected Categories**:
- National security and defense
- International relations
- Crime prevention and investigation
- Personal privacy (personal data)
- Commercial confidentiality
- Ongoing decision-making processes (limited)

- Interagency coordination problems

### Systemic Issues
- Patterns of discrimination or bias in government
- Institutional failures and accountability gaps
- Long-term policy implementation problems

## Examples

### FOI Investigation
```markdown
**Investigation: Ministry of Finance Real Estate Contracts**

**FOI Request Strategy**:
1. Initial request: "All contracts over 1 million SEK with real 
   estate companies, 2024-2025"
2. Response: 47 contracts totaling 890 million SEK
3. Follow-up: "All email correspondence regarding contracts 
   [specific IDs] with [specific companies]"
4. Response: Partial denial citing "ongoing negotiations"
5. Appeal: To Ombudsman, citing public interest override

**Document Analysis**:
- Contract [X]: No competitive bidding, sole-source award
- Company [Y]: Owned by former Ministry official (3 years ago)
- Contract value: 40% above market rates (per audit office data)
- Timeline: Award 2 weeks after official left government

**Verification**:
- Land registry: Confirmed company ownership
- Audit Office: Provided comparative pricing data
- Former Ministry colleagues: Confirmed relationship (anonymous)
- Company representative: No comment
- Ministry spokesperson: "All contracts followed proper procedures"

**Publication Decision**:
- Public interest: Clear (taxpayer money, potential conflict)
- Evidence: Strong (documents, comparative data, timeline)
- Right to reply: Exercised (Ministry, company, individual)
- Legal risk: Low (factual reporting, documented)
- Privacy: Former official is public figure, minimal privacy expectation

*Result: Published investigation with full document citations*
```

### Voting Pattern Investigation
```markdown
**Investigation: Voting Discipline Breach Pattern**

**Data Analysis**:
- Analyzed 2,487 Riksdag votes (2023-2025)
- Identified 12 MPs with >15% deviation from party line
- Focused on 3 MPs with systematic pattern in specific policy area

**Interview Process**:
- Background research on MPs' constituencies and donor relationships
- Initial contact: Open-ended questions about voting rationale
- Follow-up: Specific questions about industry connections
- Confidential sources: Two party insiders confirmed pressure

**Document Trail**:
- Committee minutes: Revealed close relationships with industry reps
- Meeting schedules: Frequent meetings with affected companies
- Campaign finance: Donations from industry PACs (legal but relevant)

**Analysis**:
- Pattern: All 3 MPs voted against party on regulations affecting donors
- Timeline: Votes correlated with campaign donation dates (+/- 30 days)
- Context: No principled explanation given, pattern suspicious

**Publication Considerations**:
- Public interest: High (accountability, potential undue influence)
- Evidence: Circumstantial but strong pattern
- Alternative explanations: MPs claim "constituency concerns"
- Balance: Present evidence, note alternative explanations
- Conclusion: Let readers judge, provide context

*Result: Published analysis with call for stronger disclosure rules*
```

## Ethical Guidelines

- **Secure communications** - Encrypted email, Signal, in-person meetings
