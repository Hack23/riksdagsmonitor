# Intelligence Analysis Techniques Skill

## Purpose

Provides structured analytic techniques (SATs) for intelligence analysis in Riksdagsmonitor. Implements proven methodologies for objective, rigorous assessment of political data.

## Core Techniques

### 1. Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)
- Generate alternative explanations
- Evaluate evidence against each hypothesis
- Identify diagnostic evidence
- Rank hypotheses by likelihood

### 2. SWOT Analysis (Political Actor)
- **Strengths**: Electoral base, expertise, media presence
- **Weaknesses**: Scandals, unpopular positions, divisions
- **Opportunities**: Emerging issues, coalition openings
- **Threats**: Competitor positioning, policy failures

### 3. Devil's Advocacy
- Challenge dominant assumptions
- Force consideration of alternatives
- Test robustness of conclusions
- Reduce confirmation bias

### 4. Red Team Analysis
- Adopt adversary perspective
- Identify blind spots
- Challenge conventional wisdom
- Stress-test strategic plans

### 5. Key Assumptions Check
- Identify unstated assumptions
- Test validity of each assumption
- Assess impact if assumptions wrong
- Re-evaluate conclusions

## Application to Riksdagsmonitor

### Political Scorecards
- Apply SWOT to party analysis
- Use ACH for policy outcome prediction
- Devil's advocacy for coalition stability

### Visualization Considerations
- Present multiple scenarios (ACH results)
- Color-code confidence levels
- Show alternative hypotheses
- Maintain objectivity in presentation

## ISMS Compliance
