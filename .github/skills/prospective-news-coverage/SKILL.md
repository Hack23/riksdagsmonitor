### Committee Meeting Preview
```markdown
**Preview: Finance Committee Budget Hearing - February 11, 2026**

## What's Happening

The Finance Committee convenes Tuesday (10:00-16:00) to review the 
Government's spring budget amendment, focusing on healthcare spending 
increases proposed by the new Finance Minister.

## The Agenda

**10:00-12:00**: Ministerial Presentation
- Finance Minister Anna Svensson's first major committee appearance
- Proposal: +8.5 billion SEK healthcare funding (2026-2027)
- Funding source: Tax revenue revision (stronger economy) + reallocation

**13:00-14:30**: Expert Testimony
- National Audit Office: Fiscal sustainability assessment
- Health Economics Institute: Healthcare system capacity analysis
- Trade Union Confederation (LO): Impact on public sector wages

**14:30-16:00**: Opposition Response
- Social Democrats: Expected to propose larger increase (+12 billion SEK)
- Sweden Democrats: May support with conditions on immigration healthcare
- Left Party: Critical of funding source (prefer wealth tax)

## Why It Matters

**Political Test**: First major negotiation for new Finance Minister. Her 
predecessor failed to manage coalition tensions, leading to resignation. 
Success here critical for government stability.

**Coalition Dynamics**: Healthcare spending divides coalition partners. 
Christian Democrats want more for eldercare, Liberals want more for 
maternal health. Compromise difficult.

**Budget Implications**: Spring amendment sets tone for fall budget. If 
this fails, confidence in government's fiscal management eroded.

## What to Watch

**Svensson's Performance**: Can she navigate committee questioning better 
than predecessor? Watch for technical command and political savvy.

**Coalition Unity**: Do government MPs present united front or reveal 
divisions? Any public disagreement signals instability.

**Opposition Strategy**: Do Social Democrats and Sweden Democrats 
coordinate? Coalition stability depends on preventing this alliance.

## Expected Outcome

**Likely**: Amendment passes with minor modifications (85% probability)
- Social Democrats may abstain rather than actively oppose
- Sweden Democrats likely to negotiate concessions

**Possible**: Significant delays or rejection (15% probability)
- Would trigger coalition crisis
- New Finance Minister's position untenable
- Early election speculation

**Next Steps**: Committee vote February 18, Plenary vote February 25
