# Data Pipeline Engineering Skill

## Purpose
Expert knowledge in designing robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines for automated data processing, focusing on reliability, monitoring, and maintainability.

## Core Principles
1. **Idempotency** - Pipeline runs produce same results
2. **Observability** - Full visibility into pipeline health
3. **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of failures
4. **Version Tracking** - Track all data changes
5. **Monitoring** - Real-time pipeline health checks

## Enforces
- ETL workflow patterns (Extract → Transform → Load)
- Automated scheduling (cron, GitHub Actions)
- Data versioning and archival
- Pipeline health monitoring
- Error recovery strategies
- Audit logging

## When to Use
- Building automated data pipelines
- Scheduling data fetching workflows
- Implementing data versioning
- Monitoring pipeline health
- Designing error recovery
