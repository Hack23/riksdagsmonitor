## Fact-Checking Protocol

### Pre-Publication Checks

**Level 1: Writer Self-Check**
- [ ] All facts from authoritative sources
- [ ] Two independent sources for major claims
- [ ] Direct quotes verbatim and in context
- [ ] Statistics from original source documents
- [ ] Names, titles, dates verified
- [ ] Links/citations functional

**Level 2: Copy Editor Review**
- [ ] Grammar, spelling, punctuation correct
- [ ] Style guide compliance verified
- [ ] Logical flow and structure sound
- [ ] Technical accuracy confirmed
- [ ] Headlines/subheads accurate
- [ ] Photo captions correct

**Level 3: Fact-Checker Verification**
- [ ] All statistics traced to original sources
- [ ] Expert claims verified with credentials check
- [ ] Historical facts cross-referenced
- [ ] Legal claims reviewed by legal expert
- [ ] Scientific/technical claims expert-verified
- [ ] Potentially controversial claims extra-verified

**Level 4: Editorial Review**
- [ ] Balanced presentation confirmed
- [ ] Ethical standards met
- [ ] Legal risk assessed
- [ ] Public interest justified
- [ ] Headline doesn't overstate
- [ ] Final approval for publication

### Source Hierarchy

**Primary Sources** (Most Authoritative):
1. Official government documents
2. Legislative records
3. Court filings and judgments
4. Academic peer-reviewed research
5. Statistical agencies (SCB, Eurostat)

**Secondary Sources** (Require Verification):
6. News reports from reputable outlets
7. Think tank reports
8. Expert interviews
9. NGO reports
10. Press releases (treated skeptically)

**Tertiary Sources** (Generally Avoid):
11. Blog posts
12. Social media posts
13. Wikipedia (useful for leads, not citations)
14. Unverified online sources

## Style Guide Quick Reference

### The Economist Conventions

**Dates**: February 6th 2026 (not Feb 6, 2026)
**Numbers**: Spell one to nine, use numerals 10+
**Currency**: SEK, euros, dollars (spell out, no symbols in body text)
**Percentages**: 10% (use symbol, no space)
**Titles**: Lowercase unless part of name (prime minister, but Prime Minister Andersson)
**Quotes**: Double quotes "standard", single quotes 'for quotes within quotes'

**Commonly Misused Terms**:
- Use "which" for non-essential clauses, "that" for essential
- "Different from" not "different to" or "different than"
- "Between" for two things, "among" for more
- "Fewer" for countable, "less" for uncountable
- "More than" for numbers, "over" for physical position

### Swedish Political Terminology

**Correct Usage**:
- Riksdag (not Parliament, except in explanatory context)
- Regeringen (Government, not Cabinet)
- Myndigheter (Agencies, plural)
- Folkpartiet liberalerna (Liberals) → L
- Socialdemokraterna (Social Democrats) → S
- Moderaterna (Moderates) → M

## Editorial Review Process

### Daily News Cycle

**Morning** (08:00-12:00):
- News gathering and source development
- Initial research and fact-checking
- Story assignments and planning

**Afternoon** (12:00-17:00):
- Writing and initial editing
- Fact-checking and verification
- Copy editing and style review

**Evening** (17:00-20:00):
- Editorial review and final approval
- Legal review if needed
- Multi-language adaptation
- Publication scheduling

### Quality Gates

**Gate 1: Story Pitch** - Concept approved by editor
**Gate 2: Draft Review** - Structure and facts sound
**Gate 3: Copy Edit** - Grammar and style correct
**Gate 4: Fact Check** - All facts verified
**Gate 5: Legal Review** - No defamation/privacy issues
**Gate 6: Editorial Approval** - Final green light
**Gate 7: Publication** - Multi-language simultaneous release

## Error Correction Protocol

### When Errors Occur

**Minor Errors** (spelling, grammar, formatting):
- Correct immediately in article
- Note in revision history: "Updated: [timestamp] - Minor correction"

**Factual Errors** (incorrect data, misattributions):
- Correct prominently in article
- Add editor's note at top: "Correction: [explanation]"
- Update social media posts if shared

**Significant Errors** (major facts wrong, unfair representation):
- Publish separate correction article
- Link from original article prominently
- Notify affected parties
- Review editorial process to prevent recurrence

## Remember

- **Accuracy is non-negotiable** - No compromise for speed
- **Style serves clarity** - Rules aid understanding, not hinder
- **The Economist standard** - Analytical, elegant, precise
- **Multiple checks** - Four-level review process mandatory
- **Transparent corrections** - Acknowledge errors promptly, prominently
- **Legal awareness** - Defamation, privacy, GDPR compliance
- **Source hierarchy** - Primary sources preferred, secondary verified
- **Attribution clear** - Readers must know source of every claim
- **Balance required** - Multiple perspectives fairly represented
- **Copy editing matters** - Grammar errors undermine credibility
