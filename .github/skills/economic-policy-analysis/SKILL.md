## Examples

### Budget Analysis
```markdown
**Spring Budget: Healthcare Boost, But at What Cost?**

Government's spring budget amendment proposes 8.5 billion SEK healthcare 
increase, but financing strategy raises fiscal sustainability concerns.

**The Numbers**:
- Healthcare spending: +8.5B SEK (2026-2027)
- Tax revenue revision: +12B SEK (stronger growth forecast)
- Spending reallocation: +2B SEK (from infrastructure)
- Net fiscal impact: +6B SEK looser stance

**Economic Context**:
- GDP growth forecast: 1.8% (2026), up from 0.8% (previous)
- Unemployment: 7.2%, stable
- Inflation: 2.3%, above Riksbank target
- Output gap: Still slightly negative (−0.3%)

**Fiscal Rules Compliance**:
- Surplus target (1% over cycle): On track (current: 0.5%)
- Expenditure ceiling: Headroom of 9B SEK remains
- Debt anchor (35% GDP): Current 32%, comfortable margin

**Expert Assessment**:
**Riksbank (unofficial view)**: Concerns about pro-cyclical stimulus. 
Economy recovering, fiscal expansion may overheat. Could complicate 
monetary policy (keep rates higher longer).

**National Institute of Economic Research**: Revenue forecast optimistic. 
Risk of over-estimation. If growth disappoints, creates 5B SEK hole.

**OECD Sweden Review**: Healthcare spending needed, but prefer 
structural reforms over pure spending increase. Efficiency gains possible.

**Distributional Analysis**:
**Winners**: Healthcare workers (wage increases), elderly (reduced wait times)
**Losers**: Infrastructure projects delayed, future taxpayers (if deficit)
**Neutral**: Middle-income taxpayers (no tax changes)

**International Comparison**:
- **Denmark**: 10.5% GDP on healthcare (vs Sweden 10.2%)
- **Norway**: 10.8% GDP (oil wealth allows higher)
- **Finland**: 9.5% GDP (tighter fiscal constraints)
- **Germany**: 11.7% GDP (insurance-based system)

**Verdict**: Politically popular, economically questionable timing. Better 
to pair with efficiency reforms. Risk of overheating economy if growth 
forecast proves optimistic.

### Monetary Policy Coverage
```markdown
**Riksbank Holds Rates, But Signals June Cut**

Sweden's central bank held its policy rate at 2.75% today, but dovish 
language suggests first cut in June as inflation pressure eases.

**The Decision**:
- Repo rate: 2.75% (unchanged, as expected)
- Vote: 5-1 (one dissent for immediate 0.25% cut)
- Forward guidance: "Rate cuts likely starting mid-2026"

**Economic Assessment**:
- Inflation: 2.3% (down from 2.8% in December)
- Core inflation: 2.1% (near target)
- Wage growth: 3.2% (moderating from 4.1%)
- GDP growth: 1.5% forecast (Q4 2025: +0.4%)

**Governor Statement** (Excerpts):
"Inflation approaching target sustainably. Labor market cooling without 
crisis. Conditions for easier policy emerging. But premature to cut now. 
Want confidence inflation stays near 2%."

**Market Reaction**:
- 10-year bond yield: −5 basis points (expectations for cuts)
- SEK: −0.3% vs EUR (weaker on dovish tone)
- OMXS30 stock index: +1.2% (lower rates positive)

**Expert Analysis**:
**SEB Economics**: "Clear signal: June cut almost certain. September 
second cut. Terminal rate 1.5% by end-2026."

**Nordea**: "More cautious. Wage growth still elevated. Risk Riksbank 
waits until September. Total cuts: 75 bp (three cuts) in 2026."

**International Context**:
- **ECB**: Held rates at 3.0%, also signaling June cut
- **Fed**: On hold at 4.5%, divergence with Europe widening
- **Bank of England**: Cut to 4.25% last month

**Political Implications**:
Lower rates help government's re-election prospects:
- Housing market stabilizes (mortgage costs down)
- Consumer spending increases
- Business investment improves
- Opposition attacks on "economic mismanagement" weaken

**Dissent Analysis**:
First Bank Deputy Governor Henry Ohlsson dissented, preferring immediate 
cut. Argues inflation target achieved, unemployment too high (7.2%). 
Riksbank risks "behind the curve" like 2022.

## Remember

- **International context** - Swedish economy deeply integrated globally
- **Fiscal rules** - Understand surplus target, expenditure ceiling, debt anchor
- **Political economy** - Economic policy choices reflect political priorities
- **Accessible language** - Explain complex economics clearly
- **Uncertainty** - Economic forecasts are uncertain; acknowledge this
- **Long-term view** - Consider sustainability, not just short-term impacts
