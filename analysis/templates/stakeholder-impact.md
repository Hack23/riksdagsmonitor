> **📌 Template Instructions:** Copy to `analysis/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/{articleType}/` and save as `stakeholder-impact.md` in the workflow's own folder (never overwrite another workflow's files). Complete the context block first, then assess each stakeholder group with specific evidence. AI must provide genuine impact analysis with named actors and dok_id citations — not generic "may affect business" prose.

> **🚨 Anti-Pattern Warning:** Generic stakeholder statements like "this may affect business environment" or "citizens may be impacted" without specific evidence are REJECTED. Every stakeholder assessment MUST name specific actors, cite specific documents, and provide specific impact mechanisms. See [ai-driven-analysis-guide.md](../methodologies/ai-driven-analysis-guide.md) for good vs. bad examples.

## 🔄 Tradecraft Context

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **F3EAD Stage** | **ANALYZE → DISSEMINATE** — translates raw documents into named-actor impact assessments that downstream synthesis, executive-brief and Family D voter-segmentation/coalition-mathematics consume. |
| **PIRs Served** | PIR-2 (opposition cohesion), PIR-3 (party-position drift), PIR-6 (economic transmission); add PIR-7 (foreign-policy alignment) when international stakeholders carry meaningful weight. |
| **Admiralty Floor** | **A1** for verbatim party / minister / committee statements; **B2** floor for inferred preference functions and reaction forecasts; **B3** acceptable for civil-society / interest-group positions sourced from press coverage. |
| **WEP + ODNI** | Position-alignment claims use **WEP** phrasing (`almost certainly opposes`, `likely supports`, `about even`); impact magnitude uses 1–5 scale with descriptive consequence narrative; confidence label per stakeholder row uses 5-level scale. |
| **Source Diversity Floor** | ≥1 primary statement per stakeholder group; ≥3 primary + ≥1 secondary for any HIGH-magnitude impact claim (impact ≥ 4); single-source HIGH-magnitude claims are downgraded or flagged `[unconfirmed]`. |
| **SAT(s) Applied** | Stakeholder Mapping (power × interest × position grid); Cross-Impact Analysis (between stakeholder groups); Devil's Advocacy (for HIGH-magnitude claims); Key Assumptions Check (on inferred preferences). |
| **ICD 203 Standards** | 1 (objectivity — equal treatment of all parties), 2 (independent), 5 (sourcing), 6 (logical argumentation), 8 (analytic value — names *who* is affected and *how*), 9 (alternative analysis — counter-narratives surfaced). |

> See [`osint-tradecraft-standards.md`](../methodologies/osint-tradecraft-standards.md) for canonical Admiralty Code / WEP / SAT / ICD 203 definitions, and [`political-style-guide.md`](../methodologies/political-style-guide.md) for the named-actor citation canon and confidence-labelling conventions.

## 🔑 Key Insights

`[REQUIRED: 3–5 sentences identifying the most significant stakeholder dynamics. Which groups are in tension? Where are unexpected winners/losers? What are the second-order political effects? Reference specific stakeholder interactions.]`

### Conflicting Impact Resolution

When stakeholder impacts conflict (e.g., Citizens benefit but Business bears costs):

| Pattern | Overall Assessment | Editorial Framing |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Citizens positive + Business negative | **Politically significant** — redistribution dynamic | Lead with citizen impact; note business costs |
| Government positive + Opposition negative | **Standard partisan** — expected dynamics | Present both perspectives equally |
| Citizens negative + Government positive | **Accountability concern** — policy vs. people | Lead with citizen impact; scrutinize government rationale |
| All stakeholders negative | **System-level problem** — policy failure signal | Frame as shared challenge requiring cross-party response |
| All stakeholders positive | **Rare consensus** — highlight cross-party achievement | Note rarity; check for hidden costs or losers |

**Publish Recommendation:** `[REQUIRED: YES — HIGH public interest / YES — MEDIUM interest / MONITOR — low standalone value]`

## 🔑 Extended Key Insights & Editorial Guidance

`[REQUIRED: 3–5 sentences identifying the most significant stakeholder dynamics. Which groups are in tension? Where are unexpected winners/losers? What are the second-order political effects?

## ✅ Pass-2 Self-Audit Checklist (v4.4 — required)

> **Purpose:** AI-FIRST principle requires a Pass-2 read-back-and-improve. After producing this artifact in Pass 1, re-read it end-to-end and verify each item below. Document any remediation in [`methodology-reflection.md`](methodology-reflection.md) §"Pass-2 audit log". Any unchecked ❌ box at the end of Pass 2 forces a Pass-3 rewrite of the affected section.

- [ ] **Tradecraft anchors honoured** — F3EAD stage matches the artifact's role; PIRs declared in the §Tradecraft Context block are actually addressed in the body; Admiralty grades attached to every external source; WEP band + ODNI confidence on every probabilistic judgement.
- [ ] **Source diversity floor met** — at least the minimum number of independent MCP sources required by the artifact's tradecraft block are cited; single-source claims are explicitly labelled `[SINGLE-SOURCE — corroboration pending]`.
- [ ] **Evidence specificity** — every quantified claim cites a `dok_id` (Riksdag), an SCB / IMF dataflow code, or a named external source with date; no "according to data" / "studies show" hand-waves.
- [ ] **Named-actor discipline** — every political claim names ≥ 1 person (party + role + dated act/quote) or labels the absence (`[diffuse — no named actor]`).
- [ ] **Counter-narrative present** — at least one explicit competing hypothesis, dissent quote, or framed objection appears in the body; "no opposition recorded" is itself a finding to label, not silence.
- [ ] **Election 2026 lens applied** — the §"Election 2026 Implications" subsection (or equivalent) addresses electoral salience, coalition pressure, and forward indicators; not boilerplate.
- [ ] **No illustrative content shipped as fact** — every `[REQUIRED]` placeholder is filled OR removed; every `Example:` block is clearly fenced or removed; no fabricated `dok_id`, vote count, or quote leaks into the final artifact.
- [ ] **Cross-references resolve** — every `[link](file.md)` in this artifact points to a file that exists in the run folder (`analysis/daily/$ARTICLE_DATE/$SUBFOLDER/`) or to a methodology / template under `analysis/`.
- [ ] **Mermaid renders** — every fenced ` ```mermaid ` block parses (no missing class definitions, no orphan nodes, no >40-node graphs that overflow viewport on mobile).
- [ ] **Line-floor check** — artifact length ≥ the per-artifact floor in [`reference-quality-thresholds.json`](../methodologies/reference-quality-thresholds.json); shorter artifacts trigger Pass-2 rewrite, never a `[truncated]` note.
