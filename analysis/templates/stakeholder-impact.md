> **📌 Template Instructions:** Copy to `analysis/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/{articleType}/` and save as `stakeholder-impact.md` in the workflow's own folder (never overwrite another workflow's files). Complete the context block first, then assess each stakeholder group with specific evidence. AI must provide genuine impact analysis with named actors and dok_id citations — not generic "may affect business" prose.

> **🚨 Anti-Pattern Warning:** Generic stakeholder statements like "this may affect business environment" or "citizens may be impacted" without specific evidence are REJECTED. Every stakeholder assessment MUST name specific actors, cite specific documents, and provide specific impact mechanisms. See [ai-driven-analysis-guide.md](../methodologies/ai-driven-analysis-guide.md) for good vs. bad examples.

## 🔑 Key Insights

`[REQUIRED: 3–5 sentences identifying the most significant stakeholder dynamics. Which groups are in tension? Where are unexpected winners/losers? What are the second-order political effects? Reference specific stakeholder interactions.]`

### Conflicting Impact Resolution

When stakeholder impacts conflict (e.g., Citizens benefit but Business bears costs):

| Pattern | Overall Assessment | Editorial Framing |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Citizens positive + Business negative | **Politically significant** — redistribution dynamic | Lead with citizen impact; note business costs |
| Government positive + Opposition negative | **Standard partisan** — expected dynamics | Present both perspectives equally |
| Citizens negative + Government positive | **Accountability concern** — policy vs. people | Lead with citizen impact; scrutinize government rationale |
| All stakeholders negative | **System-level problem** — policy failure signal | Frame as shared challenge requiring cross-party response |
| All stakeholders positive | **Rare consensus** — highlight cross-party achievement | Note rarity; check for hidden costs or losers |

**Publish Recommendation:** `[REQUIRED: YES — HIGH public interest / YES — MEDIUM interest / MONITOR — low standalone value]`

## 🔑 Extended Key Insights & Editorial Guidance

`[REQUIRED: 3–5 sentences identifying the most significant stakeholder dynamics. Which groups are in tension? Where are unexpected winners/losers? What are the second-order political effects?
