**🏢 Owner:** Hack23 AB (Org.nr 5595347807) | **🏷️ Classification:** Public

> **📌 Template Instructions:** Copy to `analysis/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/{articleType}/`. Save as `threat-analysis.md` in the workflow's own folder (never overwrite another workflow's files). Each threat requires evidence citations and multi-framework analysis. See [methodologies/political-threat-framework.md](../methodologies/political-threat-framework.md).

> **🚨 Anti-Pattern Warning:** Generic threat descriptions without attack trees are REJECTED. Every threat analysis MUST include:
> 1. **Threat Analysis Context** (metadata header with ID, date, scope)
> 2. **Political Threat Taxonomy** coverage check (all 6 democratic function categories assessed)
> 3. **Attack Tree** for the top threat (Mermaid diagram showing how the threat could succeed)
> 4. **Kill Chain assessment** (what stage has the threat progressed to?)
> 5. **Diamond Model** for the primary threat actor
> 6. **Threat Actor Profile** with ICO (Intent-Capability-Opportunity) assessment
> 7. **Evidence tables** with dok_id citations, severity scores, and confidence labels
> 8. **Forward indicators** — what MCP-detectable signals indicate escalation?
>
> **DO NOT use STRIDE categories (S/T/R/I/D/E).** Use the Political Threat Taxonomy categories:
> Narrative Integrity, Legislative Integrity, Accountability, Transparency, Democratic Process, Power Balance.
>
> **Good example:** [THREAT_MODEL.md](../../THREAT_MODEL.md) — this is the formatting quality standard.

<!--
AI-FIRST Pass-1 / Pass-2 self-check (HTML comment — invisible in rendered articles; not stripped by aggregator unless under a "## Pass 2 …" heading).

PASS 1 (creation, minimal viable artifact):
  • Fill every REQUIRED slot above; cite ≥ 1 dok_id / vote / MP / primary-source URL per major claim.
  • Use the canonical evidence anchor schema for every analytical claim row.
  • Mermaid blocks use the cyberpunk %%{init: theme/themeVariables}%% prologue and at least one `style …` or `classDef …` directive (Check 5 of 05-analysis-gate.md).

PASS 2 (read-back & improve — AI-FIRST mandatory, ≥ 180 s after Pass 1):
  • Re-read the file end-to-end; for each section verify (a) ≥ 1 evidence anchor row, (b) WEP language tightened (no "may/might/could" hedges), (c) named actors with intressent_id where applicable, (d) Mermaid colour theming present.
  • Banned-phrase scan: "intelligence theatre", "sources say", "reportedly", "it is widely believed", "experts agree", "AI_MUST_REPLACE".
  • Citation density target: ≥ 1 evidence anchor row per 100 words of analytical prose.
  • Neutrality arithmetic: equal analytical depth across the 8 Riksdag parties (S, M, SD, V, MP, C, L, KD); flag and correct any bias in the Pass-2 Self-Audit section.

ANTI-TEMPLATE — DO NOT:
  • Ship plain prose without evidence anchor tables.
  • Leave AI_MUST_REPLACE / [REQUIRED: …] placeholders in the rendered output.
  • Cite a non-primary URL when a `dok_id` or vote record is available.
  • Treat co-occurrence of keywords as coordination; uni-directional chains as bi-directional.
  • Use a Mermaid block without colour theming (Check 5 will block aggregation).
  • Skip the Pass-2 read-back (Check 6 verifies mtime ≥ birth + 180 s OR a differing pass1/ snapshot).

## 🔄 Tradecraft Context

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **F3EAD Stage** | **EXPLOIT / ANALYZE** — characterises political threats to democratic function across the 6-dimension Political Threat Taxonomy and feeds risk-assessment cascading chains, scenario-analysis tail scenarios, and forward-indicators escalation signals. |
| **PIRs Served** | PIR-1 (coalition stability), PIR-5 (institutional risk), PIR-7 (foreign-policy alignment); add PIR-4 (Election 2026 pathway) when threats target electoral integrity; PIR-2 (opposition cohesion) when threats target opposition coordination capacity. |
| **Admiralty Floor** | **B2** floor on every threat row; **A1** required when an entry quotes verbatim primary actor statements (motions, votes, ministerial declarations, public speeches); **F6** ungraded entries are flagged and downgraded; suspected disinformation must be tagged `[low-source-reliability]`. |
| **WEP + ODNI** | Threat actor **capability**, **intent**, and **opportunity** (ICO) each carry **WEP**-phrased likelihood; threat severity is 1–5 with descriptive consequence narrative; confidence label per row uses 5-level scale. |
| **Source Diversity Floor** | ≥3 primary + ≥1 secondary source per HIGH threat (severity ≥ 4); HIGH threats with single-source provenance must be downgraded to MEDIUM or flagged `[unconfirmed]`; foreign-actor threats require ≥1 cross-language corroboration where feasible. |
| **SAT(s) Applied** | Red Team (adversarial perspective); Devil's Advocacy (challenge dominant threat hypothesis); Diamond Model walk-through (adversary–capability–infrastructure–victim); Kill-Chain mapping; ACH (when ≥2 competing threat hypotheses); Premortem (for HIGH-severity rows). |
| **ICD 203 Standards** | 1 (objectivity), 2 (independent — no political alignment), 5 (sourcing), 6 (logical argumentation — attack-tree decomposition shown), 7 (uncertainty), 9 (alternative analysis — Devil's Advocacy + ACH). |

> ⚠️ **STRIDE is NOT used.** The Political Threat Taxonomy (Narrative Integrity · Legislative Integrity · Accountability · Transparency · Democratic Process · Power Balance) replaces STRIDE for political analysis. STRIDE remains valid only for the platform's software security in `THREAT_MODEL.md`.

> See [`osint-tradecraft-standards.md`](../methodologies/osint-tradecraft-standards.md) for canonical Admiralty / WEP / SAT / ICD 203 definitions, and [`political-threat-framework.md`](../methodologies/political-threat-framework.md) for the 6-dimension taxonomy, attack-tree templates, kill-chain stages, and Diamond Model adaptation.

**Analytical Coherence Check:** `[REQUIRED: Confirm that all HIGH/SEVERE threats are reflected as SWOT Threats or Weaknesses AND as Risk Register entries. If gaps exist, either add missing entries to the corresponding SWOT/Risk template or provide a 1-sentence justification for why the threat does not warrant cross-methodology reflection.]`

## 🎯 Confidence Scale Reference (5-Level)

| Level | Label | Criteria | Evidence Threshold |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------------|
| ⬛ 1 | **VERY LOW** | Speculation only, single unverified source | 0–1 sources, no corroboration |
| 🟥 2 | **LOW** | Circumstantial evidence, indirect indicators | 2 sources, indirect evidence |
| 🟧 3 | **MEDIUM** | Multiple independent sources, moderate corroboration | 3+ sources, moderate agreement |
| 🟩 4 | **HIGH** | Official records, documented data, direct evidence | Official docs, voting records, committee reports |
| 🟦 5 | **VERY HIGH** | Verified data + independent corroboration + expert consensus | Multiple official sources, cross-validated |

## ✅ Pass-2 Self-Audit Checklist (v4.4 — required)

> **Purpose:** AI-FIRST principle requires a Pass-2 read-back-and-improve. After producing this artifact in Pass 1, re-read it end-to-end and verify each item below. Document any remediation in [`methodology-reflection.md`](methodology-reflection.md) §"Pass-2 audit log". Any unchecked ❌ box at the end of Pass 2 forces a Pass-3 rewrite of the affected section.

- [ ] **Tradecraft anchors honoured** — F3EAD stage matches the artifact's role; PIRs declared in the §Tradecraft Context block are actually addressed in the body; Admiralty grades attached to every external source; WEP band + ODNI confidence on every probabilistic judgement.
- [ ] **Source diversity floor met** — at least the minimum number of independent MCP sources required by the artifact's tradecraft block are cited; single-source claims are explicitly labelled `[SINGLE-SOURCE — corroboration pending]`.
- [ ] **Evidence specificity** — every quantified claim cites a `dok_id` (Riksdag), an SCB / IMF dataflow code, or a named external source with date; no "according to data" / "studies show" hand-waves.
- [ ] **Named-actor discipline** — every political claim names ≥ 1 person (party + role + dated act/quote) or labels the absence (`[diffuse — no named actor]`).
- [ ] **Counter-narrative present** — at least one explicit competing hypothesis, dissent quote, or framed objection appears in the body; "no opposition recorded" is itself a finding to label, not silence.
- [ ] **Election 2026 lens applied** — the §"Election 2026 Implications" subsection (or equivalent) addresses electoral salience, coalition pressure, and forward indicators; not boilerplate.
- [ ] **No illustrative content shipped as fact** — every `[REQUIRED]` placeholder is filled OR removed; every `Example:` block is clearly fenced or removed; no fabricated `dok_id`, vote count, or quote leaks into the final artifact.
- [ ] **Cross-references resolve** — every `[link](file.md)` in this artifact points to a file that exists in the run folder (`analysis/daily/$ARTICLE_DATE/$SUBFOLDER/`) or to a methodology / template under `analysis/`.
- [ ] **Mermaid renders** — every fenced ` ```mermaid ` block parses (no missing class definitions, no orphan nodes, no >40-node graphs that overflow viewport on mobile).
- [ ] **Line-floor check** — artifact length ≥ the per-artifact floor in [`reference-quality-thresholds.json`](../methodologies/reference-quality-thresholds.json); shorter artifacts trigger Pass-2 rewrite, never a `[truncated]` note.
