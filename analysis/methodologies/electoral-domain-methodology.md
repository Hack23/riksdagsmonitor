## 🎯 Purpose

Family D supplies **issue-specific analytical lenses** that sharpen every workflow across electoral cycles, voter segments, coalition arithmetic, historical echoes, the media environment, delivery questions, and forward watch-lists.

These products are **core — every run produces all 7**. The output set is stable across morning, evening, realtime, weekly, and monthly workflows. What adapts per run is item-level depth (tier L1 → L3) and the substance inside each file — not whether the file exists.

### Core — every run produces all 7

| Template | Behaviour on a light-event day | Behaviour on a P0-dense day |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `election-2026-analysis.md` | Seat-projection delta vs. last poll + which parties crossed the 4 % threshold; until 2026-09 it tracks the campaign; post-2026 it tracks the new government-formation context | Full seat projection + coalition viability + campaign-phase alignment of every P0 to the election cycle |
| `voter-segmentation.md` | Baseline segment positions (5 axes: age, geography, education, income, incumbency) | Per-document segment impact table with ≥5 cohorts and quantified swing estimates |
| `coalition-mathematics.md` | Current seat map + pivotal-vote reference + confidence-vote arithmetic | Scenario branching: each contested vote run through Sainte-Laguë, pivotal-actor detection, SD-Tidöbloc-opposition matrix |
| `historical-parallels.md` (variant: `historical-baseline.md`) | Closest baseline precedent ≤ 40 years with similarity score, or explicit "no-precedent" finding | Full parallel with outcome, stakeholder behaviour, and Bayesian base-rate update |
| `media-framing-analysis.md` | Per-party + per-press-quadrant framing of the day's lead story, plus longitudinal-frame delta | Per-document frame audit with quoted examples and platform-by-platform amplification scores |
| `implementation-feasibility.md` | Audit of in-flight delivery backlog (IT, budget, regulatory, workforce) when no new bill lands | Full RACI + milestone + risk-register for each new delivery obligation |
| `forward-indicators.md` | ≥10 indicators across 4 horizons (72 h / week / month / election) refreshed every run | Indicators + thresholds + trigger-to-hypothesis mapping for every P0/P1 |

## 🗳️ Part 1 — Election 2026 Analysis (`election-2026-analysis.md`)

**Filename variant:** `election-2026-implications.md` — identical structure.

### Purpose
Translate today's policy activity into **electoral consequences** for the September 2026 Riksdag vote: seat trajectories, bloc viability, mandate strength, and pre-election narrative positioning.

### Input
- synthesis-summary.md (current events)
- Opinion polling (SIFO, Novus, Demoskop, Sentio) — use only published, dated figures
- 2018 + 2022 election results (for baseline trajectory)
- Seat-allocation rules (Sainte-Laguë modified + 4 % threshold + 12 % regional)

### Output — required structure

1. **Bloc standing table** — for Tidöavtalet (M, KD, L, SD) vs Opposition (S, V, MP, C) vs cross-bloc:
   - Current poll average · 30-day change · 90-day change · Last election
2. **Seat-projection table** — per party, showing polling-average seat translation with 4 % threshold risk flag
3. **Threshold-risk watch** — any party within ±1.0 pp of 4 %
4. **Narrative positioning** — how today's event helps / hurts each party's election narrative
5. **Mobilisation implications** — turnout implications (young-voter, first-time, non-voter)
6. **Seat-projection Mermaid** — color-coded bar by party
7. **Bloc-standing Mermaid** — color-coded stacked bar

### Required Mermaid — bloc standing

## 👥 Part 2 — Voter Segmentation (`voter-segmentation.md`)

### Purpose
Identify which **voter segments** are materially affected by today's events and how each segment's pre-existing political alignment interacts with the new signal.

### Input
- SCB demographic microdata (age × region × income × education × sector)
- Polling cross-tabs (published segment-level data only)
- Prior election turnout + vote-by-segment data (SCB Statistiska Meddelanden)

   - Current political alignment · Policy exposure to today's events · Likely response
2. **Segment-issue Mermaid** — color-coded quadrant (alignment × exposure)
3. **Mobilisation index** — which segments are most "move-able" given the current evidence
4. **Disaggregation notes** — where SCB data permits further cuts (e.g. foreign-born, women 35–44, etc.)

### Required Mermaid — segment quadrant

```mermaid
quadrantChart

## 🧮 Part 3 — Coalition Mathematics (`coalition-mathematics.md`)

### Purpose
Compute the **arithmetic of government formation, confidence, and policy coalition** — which combinations clear 175 seats, which survive a misstatement of confidence, and which emerge as issue-specific coalitions for today's vote.

### Input

2. **Majority viability matrix** — all plausible 3–5 party coalitions with seat totals, tolerance to loss of 1 party, ideological coherence score
3. **Confidence arithmetic** — who can block a confidence vote, who can trigger it
4. **Issue-specific coalitions** — for today's top 3 items, which coalition actually materialised (from voting data)
5. **Cohesion indicators** — party vote-split percentages on today's items
