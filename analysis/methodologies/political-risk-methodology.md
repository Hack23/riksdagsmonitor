## 🎯 Purpose

This methodology provides the authoritative framework for political risk assessment in Riksdagsmonitor's analytical workflows. Beyond the basic 5×5 Likelihood × Impact matrix, this methodology includes:

- **Cascading risk analysis** — how one risk event triggers a chain of subsequent risks
- **Bayesian updating** — how to revise risk scores as new evidence arrives
- **Risk interconnection mapping** — visualizing dependencies between risk types
- **Scenario tree analysis** — probabilistic branching for complex political situations

This adapts the quantitative approach from [Hack23 ISMS Risk_Assessment_Methodology.md](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Risk_Assessment_Methodology.md) to Swedish parliamentary politics.

See [reference/isms-risk-assessment-adaptation.md](../reference/isms-risk-assessment-adaptation.md) for the complete ISMS-to-political mapping.

## 📐 Core Methodology: Likelihood × Impact

All political risks are scored using a **5×5 matrix**. Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact.

### Likelihood Scale (1–5)

| Score | Label | Definition | Parliamentary Analogy |
|:-----:|-------|------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Rare** | <5% probability in assessment window | Coalition collapse with 176-seat majority |
| 2 | **Unlikely** | 5–20% probability | Budget vote fails despite coalition agreement |
| 3 | **Possible** | 21–40% probability | SD defects on single non-budget vote |
| 4 | **Likely** | 41–70% probability | Opposition files no-confidence motion when polls shift |
| 5 | **Almost Certain** | >70% probability | Government proposes budget in September |

### Impact Scale (1–5)

| Score | Label | Definition | Political Example |
|:-----:|-------|------------|------------------|
| 1 | **Negligible** | Routine disruption; normal operations continue | Minor committee delay |
| 2 | **Minor** | Moderate disruption; corrective action straightforward | Single bill rejected; government re-submits |
| 3 | **Moderate** | Significant disruption; coalition relationship strained | Major budget amendment forced by opposition |
| 4 | **Major** | Severe disruption; coalition integrity threatened | Minister forced to resign |
| 5 | **Severe** | Democratic crisis; constitutional mechanisms triggered | Government falls; extraordinary election called |

### Risk Matrix

    end
```

| Score | Tier | Colour | Action |
|:-----:|------|--------|--------|
| 1–4 | **Low** | 🟢 | Monitor; mention in weekly digest |
| 5–9 | **Medium** | 🟡 | Active monitoring; flag in daily analysis |
| 10–14 | **High** | 🟠 | Priority assessment; include in news |
| 15–25 | **Critical** | 🔴 | Immediate analysis; breaking news consideration |

## 🤝 Coalition Stability Risk

Coalition risk is the most politically distinctive risk type in Swedish parliamentary analysis.

### Coalition Stability Factors

```

### Coalition Collapse Probability (90-day window)

| Likelihood of Collapse | Seat Margin | Policy Cohesion | Electoral Pressure | Combined Score |
|------------------------|:-----------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|
| **LOW (<15%)** | ≥176 operational buffer | High (all parties aligned) | Low (polls stable) | L≤2, I≤3 |
| **MEDIUM (15–35%)** | 175 bare majority (no buffer) | Medium (one party strained) | Medium (5+ point poll shift) | L=3, I=3–4 |
| **HIGH (>35%)** | <175 no majority | Low (multi-party tension) | High (SD threats withdrawal) | L≥4, I≥4 |

> **Note on majority arithmetic:** A formal Riksdag majority requires **≥175 of 349 seats**. However, absences and abstentions mean that ≥176 seats provide an "operational buffer" — the practical threshold for reliable legislative passage. The table above uses this distinction: ≥176 = comfortable (LOW), exactly 175 = bare majority (MEDIUM), <175 = no majority (HIGH).

---

## 📋 Policy Implementation Risk

Policy implementation risks assess the probability that a proposed policy fails to pass, is significantly amended, or is blocked:

| Stage | Default Likelihood | Risk Amplifiers | Risk Reducers |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Proposition submitted | L=2 | Opposition majority, SD conditions | Cross-party agreement |
| Committee review | L=2 | Dissenting committee reports | Government committee majority |
| Floor debate scheduled | L=3 | No-confidence backdrop | Vote whipped by all coalition parties |
| Vote imminent | L=1–4 | Internal defections signalled | Prior vote counting confirms majority |
| Enacted | L=1 (reversal) | New government formed | Constitutional entrenchment |

---

## 💰 Budget Risk Assessment

Swedish budget risk has unique characteristics due to the Riksdag's fiscal framework:

### Budget Timeline Risk Points

```mermaid
timeline
    title Swedish Budget Risk Calendar
    section September
        Budget Proposition : Tabled by Finansminister
        Risk Level: HIGH if coalition unstable
    section October–November
        FiU Committee Review : Amendments filed
        Risk Level: MEDIUM normally
    section November
        Riksdag Budget Vote : Deadline vote
        Risk Level: CRITICAL if no majority confirmed
    section December
        Budget Implementation : Government executes
        Risk Level: LOW if passed
    section April
        Spring Amending Budget : Adjustments
        Risk Level: LOW–MEDIUM
```

**FiU (Finansutskottet) Dissent Tracking:** Track formal dissenting opinions (reservationer) filed by opposition parties. Each reservation from a coalition party signals **High** policy risk for that budget line.

---

## 🗳️ Electoral Positioning Risk

Electoral risk quantifies how political events affect parties' electoral prospects over the 4-year Swedish electoral cycle:

| Electoral Phase | Risk Focus | Key Indicators |
|----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Year 1 (post-election)** | Coalition formation stability | Cooperation agreement durability |
| **Year 2 (mid-term)** | Policy delivery credibility | Legislation passing rate; SCB data |
| **Year 3 (positioning)** | Pre-election narrative | Poll trends; party conference resolutions |
| **Year 4 (campaign)** | Electoral positioning | Budget generosity; flagship policy status |

**Note:** General elections in Sweden are held the second Sunday of September every 4 years. Current cycle: September 2022 → **September 2026**.

## 📊 Calibration Examples

Real Swedish political scenarios as scoring anchors:

| Scenario | Likelihood | Impact | Score | Tier | Rationale |
|----------|:----------:|:------:|:-----:|------|-----------|
| SD conditionally supports budget | 4 | 4 | 16 | 🔴 Critical | Frequent pattern; major governance impact |
| SD conditionally supports government on migration | 4 | 4 | 16 | 🔴 Critical | Tidöavtalet leverage; SD extracts concessions as price for continued support |
| L exits coalition over migration | 2 | 5 | 10 | 🟠 High | Historically rare; would collapse government |
| L exits government coalition | 2 | 5 | 10 | 🟠 High | L departure reduces M+KD to ~131 seats; SD support alone insufficient for majority |
| Minor committee report delayed | 1 | 1 | 1 | 🟢 Low | Routine; no political consequence |
| Budget vote passes with expected margin | 4 | 1 | 4 | 🟢 Low | Likely but low-impact routine event |
| Plenary adopts budget with expected margin | 4 | 1 | 4 | 🟢 Low | Standard legislative process; M+KD+L+SD bloc votes cohesively |
| KU investigation into government minister | 3 | 3 | 9 | 🟡 Medium | Possible; damages but rarely fatal |
| Motion of no confidence (misstroendeförklaring) | 1 | 5 | 5 | 🟡 Medium | Requires 175 votes; very rare but triggers government fall if passed |
| No-confidence motion passes | 1 | 5 | 5 | 🟡 Medium | Very rare; catastrophic if it occurs |
| New SOU recommends major pension reform | 4 | 3 | 12 | 🟠 High | Likely publication; major policy implications |
| Major government proposition on AI regulation | 4 | 3 | 12 | 🟠 High | Likely given EU AI Act transposition deadline; cross-cutting policy with industry impact |
| Article 7/EU sanctions against Sweden | 1 | 5 | 5 | 🟡 Medium | Extremely rare EU mechanism; would signal severe rule-of-law concerns |

## 🤖 AI Analysis Protocol for Risk Assessment

The AI agent **MUST** follow this protocol when performing risk assessment:

1. **Read this methodology** — understand the 5×5 matrix, calibration examples, coalition stability factors, AND the advanced techniques below
2. **Query MCP tools** for evidence:
   - `search_voteringar` — recent vote margins to assess coalition stability
   - `search_dokument` with `organ=FiU` — budget committee status
   - `search_dokument` with `organ=KU` — constitutional committee investigations
   - `search_anforanden` — parliamentary debate signals
   - World Bank / SCB data — economic context for budget and electoral risk
3. **Score each risk dimension** using the 5×5 matrix with evidence
4. **Apply calibration** — compare against the calibration examples above
5. **Perform cascading risk analysis** — identify risk chains and second-order effects
6. **Map risk interconnections** — which risks amplify each other?
7. **Apply Bayesian updating** — adjust base rates with new evidence
8. **Assign overall risk level** — weighted by dimension (Coalition 0.30, Policy 0.25, Budget 0.20, Electoral 0.15, External 0.10)

### Risk-to-SWOT Integration

Risk assessment results feed directly into SWOT analysis:
- **Risk Score ≥ 15 (Critical)** → SWOT Threat entry (HIGH confidence, HIGH impact)
- **Risk Score 10–14 (High)** → SWOT Threat or Weakness entry (MEDIUM+ confidence)
- **Risk Score 5–9 (Medium)** → SWOT Weakness or Threat entry (flag for monitoring)
- **Risk Score 1–4 (Low)** → Informational only; no SWOT entry required

## 🔗 Advanced Technique 1: Cascading Risk Analysis

Political risks rarely occur in isolation. A **cascading risk chain** models how one risk event triggers subsequent risks:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    R1["⚠️ TRIGGER RISK:<br/>SD demands migration<br/>policy concession<br/>L=4, I=3, Score=12 🟠"]
    R1 --> R2["⚠️ SECOND-ORDER:<br/>Government refuses;<br/>coalition tension rises<br/>L=3, I=4, Score=12 🟠"]
    R2 --> R3A["⚠️ BRANCH A:<br/>SD withdraws budget<br/>support<br/>L=2, I=5, Score=10 🟠"]
    R2 --> R3B["⚠️ BRANCH B:<br/>Government compromises;<br/>L loses face<br/>L=3, I=3, Score=9 🟡"]
    R3A --> R4A["🔴 CASCADING CRISIS:<br/>No-confidence vote<br/>L=2, I=5, Score=10 🟠"]
    R3B --> R4B["🟡 MANAGED STRESS:<br/>Internal L party dissent<br/>L=3, I=2, Score=6 🟡"]

    style R1 fill:#fd7e14,color:#fff
    style R2 fill:#fd7e14,color:#fff

    style R3B fill:#ffc107,color:#000
    style R4A fill:#dc3545,color:#fff
    style R4B fill:#ffc107,color:#000
```

### Cascading Risk Construction Protocol

1. **Identify trigger risk** — the initial event that starts the chain
2. **Map first-order consequences** — what happens immediately if the trigger occurs?
3. **Map second-order consequences** — what happens as a result of the first-order effects?
4. **Identify branching points** — where does the chain split into alternative paths?
5. **Score each node** independently using the 5×5 matrix
6. **Calculate cumulative chain probability** — multiply probabilities along each path
7. **Identify circuit breakers** — what intervention could stop the chain at each stage?

### Cascading Risk Table

| Chain Stage | Risk Event | Likelihood | Impact | Score | Circuit Breaker |
|:-----------:|-----------|:----------:|:------:|:-----:|----------------|
| Trigger | `[Initial event]` | `[1-5]` | `[1-5]` | `[L×I]` | `[What stops it here?]` |
| 1st Order | `[Immediate consequence]` | `[1-5]` | `[1-5]` | `[L×I]` | `[Intervention point]` |
| 2nd Order | `[Follow-on effect]` | `[1-5]` | `[1-5]` | `[L×I]` | `[Intervention point]` |
| Terminal | `[Final outcome]` | `[1-5]` | `[1-5]` | `[L×I]` | `[Recovery action]` |

## 📊 Advanced Technique 2: Bayesian Updating for Risk Scores

Political risk scores should be **updated** as new evidence arrives, not just recalculated from scratch. Bayesian updating provides a disciplined framework:

### Update Protocol

| Step | Action | Example |
|:----:|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Start with prior** — the current risk score based on existing evidence | "Coalition collapse risk: L=2, I=5, Score=10 (prior)" |
| 2 | **New evidence arrives** — an MCP-observable event changes the picture | "SD publicly demands migration concession (MCP: interpellation 2025/26:789)" |
| 3 | **Assess evidence strength** — how much should this shift the score? | Strong evidence (official statement) → adjust by +1 on likelihood |
| 4 | **Update score** — adjust likelihood and/or impact based on evidence | "Coalition collapse risk: L=3, I=5, Score=15 (posterior)" |
| 5 | **Document the update** — record prior, evidence, and posterior | "Prior 10 → Evidence: SD interpellation → Posterior 15 (+5)" |

### Evidence Strength Table

| Evidence Type | Likelihood Adjustment | Example |
|-------------|:---------------------:|---------|
| Official Riksdag document (proposition, vote) | ±1 to ±2 | Vote passes/fails |
| Named politician public statement | ±1 | SD leader demands concession |
| Verified media report with named sources | ±0.5 to ±1 | DN reports coalition talks stalled |
| Single unnamed source | ±0.5 | "Sources say minister may resign" |
| Statistical data (SCB, World Bank) | ±0.5 to ±1 | GDP growth data, unemployment change |

## 🔗 Advanced Technique 3: Risk Interconnection Mapping

Political risks are **interconnected** — coalition risk affects budget risk, which affects electoral risk. Map these connections to understand system-level vulnerability:

```mermaid
graph TD
    CR["🤝 Coalition Risk<br/>Score: [X]"]
    PR["📋 Policy Risk<br/>Score: [X]"]
    BR["💰 Budget Risk<br/>Score: [X]"]

    XR["🌍 External Risk<br/>Score: [X]"]

    CR -->|"Budget depends on<br/>coalition agreement"| BR
    PR -->|"Policy failures erode<br/>electoral support"| ER
    BR -->|"Budget cuts affect<br/>policy capacity"| PR
    XR -->|"EU pressure forces<br/>unwanted policy"| PR
    XR -->|"Economic headwinds<br/>squeeze budget"| BR
    ER -->|"Election proximity increases<br/>coalition posturing"| CR

    style CR fill:#dc3545,color:#fff
    style PR fill:#fd7e14,color:#fff
    style BR fill:#ffc107,color:#000
    style ER fill:#0d6efd,color:#fff
    style XR fill:#6f42c1,color:#fff
```

### Interconnection Strength Assessment

| From → To | Connection Strength | Mechanism | Evidence |
|:---------:|:-------------------:|-----------|---------|
| Coalition → Budget | **Strong** | Budget requires coalition majority | `[vote records]` |
| Coalition → Policy | **Strong** | Policy delivery requires coalition unity | `[committee reports]` |
| Policy → Electoral | **Medium** | Policy success/failure affects polls | `[polling data]` |
| External → Budget | **Medium** | EU/economic pressures constrain budget | `[SCB/World Bank data]` |
| Electoral → Coalition | **Medium** | Election proximity strains coalition | `[calendar, debate rhetoric]` |

**System-Level Risk Assessment:** When ≥3 risk categories score ≥10 (High), the system is in a **fragile state** where any single trigger event could cascade across multiple risk dimensions simultaneously.

---

## 🌳 Advanced Technique 4: Scenario Tree Analysis

For complex risk situations with multiple branching points, construct a **scenario tree** showing probability-weighted outcomes:

```mermaid

```

### Scenario Tree Table

| Path | Probability | Outcome | Key Trigger | Watch Indicator |
|------|:----------:|---------|------------|----------------|
| Stability → Budget passes | 48% (60%×80%) | Normal governance continues | SD confirms budget support | SD budget stance statement |
| Stability → Budget amended | 12% (60%×20%) | Minor adjustments, governance continues | Partial SD objections | Committee amendment volume |
| Stress → Compromise | 15% (30%×50%) | Short-term disruption resolved | Public negotiation succeeds | Joint coalition statement |
| Crisis → New coalition | 6% (10%×60%) | Government changes, democracy functions | Coalition collapse triggers realignment | No-confidence vote result |
| Crisis → Election | 4% (10%×40%) | Extraordinary election called | No alternative coalition possible | Riksdag vote on dissolution |

## 📡 MCP Data Sources for Risk Assessment

The following table maps each risk category to the primary MCP tools and query strategies used to gather evidence for scoring:

| Risk Category | Primary MCP Tools | Query Strategy |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Coalition stability** | `search_voteringar` + internal voting pattern analysis (non‑MCP) | Track M+KD+L+SD voting cohesion; detect defections and abstention spikes |
| **Policy implementation** | `get_propositioner`, `search_dokument` | Monitor committee referrals, plenary vote outcomes, and reservation filings |
| **Legislative integrity** | `search_voteringar`, `get_betankanden` | Track contested votes (margin <10 seats), reservation analysis per party |
| **Economic governance** | `get_propositioner`, `search_dokument` | Budget bills (FiU), fiscal forecasts, spring amending budgets |
| **Social cohesion** | `search_anforanden`, `get_interpellationer` | Migration/welfare debate intensity; interpellation frequency by topic |
| **Democratic process** | `get_calendar_events`, `search_voteringar` | Participation rates, vote margins, plenary attendance patterns |

### Query Examples

```bash
# Coalition cohesion: party-level breakdown on recent budget (FiU1)
get_voting_group(rm="2025/26", bet="FiU1")

# Policy risk: track contested committee reports
get_betankanden(rm="2025/26", organ="SfU")  # Social insurance committee

# Democratic process: monitor plenary participation (party-level absences)
get_voting_group(rm="2025/26", rost="Frånvarande")

# Social cohesion: migration debate intensity
search_anforanden(text="migration", rm="2025/26")
```

## ⚠️ Anti-Pattern Warning

> **REJECTED:** Generic risk statements like _"medium risk"_ without specific L×I scores, evidence, or calibration examples are **REJECTED**. Every risk assessment MUST include:
>
> 1. **Explicit Likelihood (1–5) and Impact (1–5) scores** with justification
> 2. **MCP evidence** — specific document IDs, vote records, or speech references
> 3. **Calibration anchor** — which calibration example is this most similar to?
> 4. **Confidence level** — HIGH (multiple MCP sources), MEDIUM (single source), LOW (inference only)
>
> ❌ _"Coalition risk is medium"_ → Not actionable, no evidence, no scores  
> ✅ _"Coalition risk: L=3, I=4, Score=12 (HIGH). Evidence: SD voted against government on SfU14 punkt 3 (search_voteringar rm=2025/26). Calibrated against 'SD conditionally supports government on migration' scenario."_

## ⏱️ Temporal Analysis Protocol (v2.1)

Risk scores are **point-in-time snapshots** that degrade as the political environment evolves. This section defines how to track risk evolution over time, when to trigger re-scoring, and how to flag stale assessments.

### Re-Scoring Triggers

The following observable events **require** immediate risk re-scoring for any affected risk category:

| Trigger Event | Affected Risk Category | MCP Detection Tool | Expected Response Time |
|:---|:---|:---|:---:|
| Riksdag vote outcome (pass/fail) | Coalition, Policy, Budget | `search_voteringar` | Same day |
| Lagrådet opinion published | Policy, Constitutional | `search_dokument(doktyp=yttr)` | Same day |
| Committee hearing conclusion | Policy, Legislative | `get_betankanden` | Same day |
| Budget publication or amending budget | Budget, Coalition, Electoral | `get_propositioner` | Same day |
| Court ruling (ECJ, Supreme Court) | Policy, External, Constitutional | `search_dokument` fulltext | Same day |
| Opinion poll (Novus, SCB partisympati) | Electoral, Coalition | External data | Within 2 days |
| Government reshuffle or resignation | Coalition, Electoral | News monitoring | Immediate |
| EU directive transposition deadline | External, Policy | EU calendar | 7 days before deadline |
| Parliamentary recess start/end | All categories | `get_calendar_events` | Day of |

### Staleness Rules

| Risk Age (since last evidence update) | Status | Required Action |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| 0–3 days | **Current** ✅ | No action — score is fresh |
| 4–7 days | **Aging** 🟡 | Acceptable if no trigger events occurred; note age in assessment |
| 8–14 days | **Stale** 🟠 | Flag for review — analyst must verify score still holds via MCP query |
| 15+ days | **Expired** 🔴 | Score MUST be re-assessed before inclusion in any output |

> **Rule:** Every risk score published in a daily, weekly, or monthly analysis MUST include its last-evidence date. Scores older than 7 days without new evidence must carry a `⚠️ STALE` marker.

### Temporal Risk Evolution Table Template

Use this template to track how a single risk evolves across multiple analysis cycles:

## 📐 Bayesian Updating Worked Example (v2.1)

This section provides a **complete, date-specific worked example** showing how to apply the Bayesian updating protocol from §Advanced Technique 2 in practice.

### Scenario: ECHR Challenge to Swedish Migration Policy

**Context:** The government's migration reform bill (prop. 2025/26:117) faces a potential European Court of Human Rights challenge. Track how the risk score evolves as new evidence arrives over 7 days.

#### Day 1 (Tuesday 2026-03-24): Initial Assessment

| Risk Factor | Likelihood | Impact | Score | Evidence |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| ECHR challenge to migration bill | 3 (Possible) | 4 (Significant) | **12** | Prop. 2025/26:117 passed committee (SfU) with 3 reservations; legal scholars cited in DN question ECHR compatibility; no formal complaint yet |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM — academic opinion but no official ECHR action  
**MCP sources:** `get_propositioner(rm="2025/26")`, `get_betankanden(organ="SfU")`

#### Day 3 (Thursday 2026-03-26): Lagrådet Opinion Published

**New evidence:** Lagrådet (Council on Legislation) publishes opinion on prop. 2025/26:117 stating "no conflict with ECHR Article 3 or Article 8" — favorable to government position.

| Step | Action | Value |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| 1 | **Prior score** | L=3, I=4, Score=**12** |
| 2 | **New evidence** | Lagrådet favorable opinion (official document, HIGH authority) |
| 3 | **Evidence strength** | Official Riksdag document → ±1 to ±2 adjustment |
| 4 | **Direction** | Favorable opinion **reduces** likelihood of successful ECHR challenge |
| 5 | **Posterior score** | L=**2** (−1), I=4 (unchanged), Score=**8** |

**Updated risk:** L=2, I=4, Score=**8** (was 12 → −4)  
**Confidence:** HIGH — multiple sources including Lagrådet official position  
**Citation:** `search_dokument(doktyp=yttr, titel="prop. 2025/26:117")`

#### Day 5 (Saturday 2026-03-28): Opposition Files KU Complaint

**New evidence:** Socialdemokraterna (S) files a KU complaint (konstitutionsutskottsanmälan) alleging the migration bill process was rushed without adequate remiss period.

| Step | Action | Value |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| 1 | **Prior score** | L=2, I=4, Score=**8** |
| 2 | **New evidence** | KU complaint filed (official Riksdag document) — procedural challenge |
| 3 | **Evidence strength** | Official document → ±1 adjustment; procedural complaints are common |
| 4 | **Direction** | KU complaints **increase** procedural risk but don't directly affect ECHR |
| 5 | **Assessment** | Impact stays at 4; Likelihood increases to **3** (procedural vulnerability reinforces ECHR risk pathway) |
| 6 | **Posterior score** | L=**3** (+1), I=4 (unchanged), Score=**12** |

**Updated risk:** L=3, I=4, Score=**12** (was 8 → +4)  
**Confidence:** HIGH — two official documents with opposing indicators  
**Citation:** `search_dokument(organ="KU", rm="2025/26")`

#### Day 7 (Monday 2026-03-30): No New Evidence

**No new evidence for 2 days.** Score carries forward unchanged:

- Risk: L=3, I=4, Score=**12** `Last evidence: 2026-03-28 (2 days ago)`
- Staleness status: **Current** ✅ (within 3-day window)
- **Next scheduled check:** Tuesday 2026-03-31 — monitor for KU committee response and any ECHR filings

#### Summary: 7-Day Risk Evolution

| Date | Event | L | I | Score | Δ | Confidence |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 2026-03-24 | Initial assessment | 3 | 4 | 12 | — | MEDIUM |
| 2026-03-26 | Lagrådet favorable opinion | 2 | 4 | 8 | −4 | HIGH |
| 2026-03-28 | S files KU complaint | 3 | 4 | 12 | +4 | HIGH |
| 2026-03-30 | No new evidence | 3 | 4 | 12 | 0 | HIGH (Current) |

> **Key Insight:** Risk scores are non-monotonic — they can decrease and increase as competing evidence accumulates. The analyst must track each directional change with its specific evidence, not simply report the latest score.
