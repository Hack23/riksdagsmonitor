            <p><strong>Stockholm, February 7, 2026</strong> — In light of the approaching September 2026 general election and the EU's recently passed implementation deadline for the Platform Work Directive, two interpellations from autumn 2024 stand out as particularly significant. Eva Lindh, the Social Democrats' labor market policy spokesperson, posed two sharp questions to the government about worker protections in the modern Swedish economy: how would Sweden implement the EU's Platform Work Directive for gig workers, and should the country follow Norway's example in limiting subcontractor chains in the construction industry?</p>
            
            <p>The debates, held in the Riksdag on September 4, 2024, exposed deep ideological divides between the opposition and the center-right four-party government. Lindh's interpellations (2024/25:734 and 2024/25:740) were directed at Labor Market Minister Johan Britz (L - Liberals) and Minister for Public Administration Erik Slottner (KD - Christian Democrats) — two ministers whose responses then foreshadowed the government's cautious balancing act between business freedom and worker protection that came to characterize the EU directive's implementation during 2025.</p>

            <h2>The Interpellation Process: When Opposition Meets Government</h2>
            
            <p>The interpellation is one of the Riksdag's sharpest tools for parliamentary oversight. Unlike simple questions, interpellations require written responses from ministers and are followed by public debates in the chamber. This is where government policy is scrutinized, explained — and sometimes defended against probing criticism.</p>
            
            <p>For Eva Lindh, these two interpellations represent a strategic offensive. As the Social Democrats' labor market policy spokesperson, she has identified two areas where government policy diverges markedly from Social Democratic tradition: EU-driven worker protection legislation and regulation of the construction industry's often exploitative subcontractor structures.</p>
            
            <p>The timing was significant. With construction industry labor immigration a sensitive political topic, these interpellations put their finger on the government's most vulnerable points — areas where the coalition's liberal and Christian Democratic components must balance market liberalism against social responsibility. Now, seventeen months later and with the election just seven months away, we can see how these debates predicted the government's implementation strategy.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Gig Economy: Battle Over the EU Platform Work Directive</h2>
            
            <p><strong>The EU Platform Work Directive</strong>, adopted in 2024, forces member states to reconsider how they classify gig workers — the millions of people who work via digital platforms like Uber, Foodora and delivery apps. The directive's core: a presumption of employment. If a platform exercises sufficient control over a worker (sets prices, monitors performance, restricts customer base), the worker should be classified as an employee, not a self-employed contractor.</p>
            
            <p>Eva Lindh's interpellation 2024/25:734 shone a spotlight on the government's implementation strategy. Her questions were sharp:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>How does the government ensure Sweden meets the EU directive's minimum standards for worker protection?</li>
                <li>Will the government introduce a presumption of employment, or rely on Swedish labor law's "existing framework"?</li>
                <li>What mechanisms does the government propose to prevent misclassification of workers as "self-employed" when they are effectively employees?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Labor Market Minister Johan Britz's response was carefully calibrated. The Liberal minister emphasized the government's <em>"commitment to flexibility and innovation"</em> while acknowledging <em>"the importance of fair working conditions"</em>. Britz argued that Sweden's existing labor law framework — based on collective agreements between trade unions and employers — already provides substantial protections.</p>
            
            <p>But Britz avoided committing to the EU directive's specific presumption mechanism. Instead, he emphasized the government's "ongoing evaluation" of implementation options, suggesting reluctance to introduce strict legislation that could limit platform companies' operational flexibility.</p>
            
            <h3>Liberal vs. Social Democratic Philosophy</h3>
            
            <p>The discrepancy exposes fundamental ideological differences. For Social Democrats like Lindh, the gig economy is a case of <em>"flexploitation"</em> — companies exploiting legal gray zones to avoid employer responsibilities. The solution: clear legislation classifying most gig workers as employees, giving them rights to minimum wage, paid vacation, sick insurance and union membership.</p>
            
            <p>For Liberals like Britz, the gig economy is a source of entrepreneurship and flexibility. Many gig workers, Liberals argue, <em>prefer</em> self-employed status for the freedom it provides. Over-regulation risks stifling innovation and destroying flexible work opportunities that benefit students, part-time workers and small business owners.</p>
            
            <p>The Christian Democratic coalition partner KD has historically emphasized <em>"social enterprise"</em> — the idea that businesses have moral obligations beyond profit maximization. But in practice, KD's position aligns with the Liberals' on gig economy issues, prioritizing business freedom over statutory worker protections.</p>
            
            <h3>International Comparisons: Denmark and France</h3>
            
            <p>Eva Lindh pointed to international models. <strong>Denmark</strong> has introduced a presumption of employment for platform workers meeting specific criteria (the platform sets prices, monitors quality, or restricts customer base). The result: thousands of formerly "self-employed" workers have been reclassified as employees, with access to Denmark's Supplementary Labor Market Pension (ATP) and union representation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>France</strong> has gone even further, with court decisions forcing Uber to classify drivers as employees in certain jurisdictions. French unions have successfully argued that Uber's algorithmic control — including automated routing, customer ratings and ability to "deactivate" drivers — constitutes de facto employer direction.</p>
            
            <p>Sweden's government has chosen a more cautious path. Britz's argument rests on Swedish labor law's unique character: the <em>Swedish model</em>, where collective agreements between unions and employer organizations regulate wages and working conditions rather than legislation. Liberals argue this model is flexible enough to handle the gig economy's challenges without additional statutory presumptions.</p>
            
            <p>Critics — including Lindh and LO (the Swedish Trade Union Confederation) — argue that gig economy platforms systematically avoid collective agreements, rendering the Swedish model ineffective. Without statutory presumption of employment, Sweden risks becoming a "race to the bottom" among EU members.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Subcontractor Chains: The Construction Industry's Exploitation Problem</h2>
            
            <p>Eva Lindh's second interpellation (2024/25:740) directed attention to another labor market problem: <strong>subcontractor chains</strong> in the construction and logistics sectors. Sweden's construction industry is notorious for complex subcontractor structures — main contractors hire subcontractors, who hire sub-subcontractors, who hire additional layers of subcontractors, often in chains stretching five or six levels deep.</p>
            
            <p>These chains create <em>"responsibility displacement"</em>: when wages aren't paid, safety rules are ignored or workers are exploited, each level shifts blame downward. The main contractor claims they're only responsible for direct subcontractors. Subcontractors claim they can't control sub-subcontractors' behavior. In the end, workers — often migrants with precarious employment contracts — are left without protection.</p>
            
            <p>Lindh's solution: statutory limits on subcontractor chain length. She pointed to <strong>Norway</strong>, where construction regulations limit subcontractor chains to a maximum of three levels for public contracts. Norwegian researchers have shown this rule has reduced the presence of unscrupulous contractors and improved wage control.</p>
            
            <h3>Minister Slottner's Response: Balance and Crime Fighting</h3>
            
            <p>Minister for Public Administration Erik Slottner (KD) met Lindh's interpellation with a cautious tone. Slottner acknowledged the problem: <em>"The government is aware of risks for labor market exploitation and social fraud in complex subcontractor chains."</em></p>
            
            <p>But Slottner was reluctant to advocate the Norwegian model's hard limits. Instead, he emphasized existing measures:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Procurement rules:</strong> Public authorities are encouraged to require transparency about subcontractors in tender processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Work Environment Authority inspections:</strong> Increased resources for construction site inspections.</li>
                <li><strong>Main contractor liability:</strong> Certain legal obligations for main contractors to ensure subcontractors follow labor law rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Crime fighting:</strong> Coordinated efforts by police and tax authorities against economic crime in the construction industry.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Slottner's Christian Democratic perspective was clear: KD's emphasis on <em>"social responsibility"</em> combined with reluctance to introduce rules that could limit business freedom or increase administrative burden for legitimate contractors. Slottner argued that hard limits on subcontractor chains could disadvantage legitimate small and medium-sized enterprises that are specialized subcontractors.</p>
            
            <h3>The Sweden Democrats' Potential Influence</h3>
            
            <p>An interesting political dimension: <strong>the Sweden Democrats (SD)</strong>, who support the center-right government without sitting in it, have historically emphasized <em>"law and order"</em> on economic issues. SD has criticized foreign construction companies for undermining Swedish working conditions and expressed support for stricter controls.</p>
            
            <p>This creates potential for cross-party pressure. If the Social Democrats, Left Party and Green Party succeed in gaining SD support for subcontractor chain limits — with the argument that they combat economic crime and protect Swedish working conditions — the government could be forced to reconsider its position.</p>
            
            <p>So far, however, SD has not explicitly backed Lindh's proposals, likely due to coalition loyalty and a desire not to undermine the government's business-friendly agenda.</p>

            <h2>Coalition Dynamics: Liberals and Christian Democrats Balance Interests</h2>
            
            <p>These interpellation debates reveal tensions within Sweden's center-right coalition. The government consists of four parties:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Moderates (M):</strong> The dominant conservative party, traditionally business-friendly, advocates tax cuts and deregulation.</li>
                <li><strong>The Liberals (L):</strong> Socio-liberal party emphasizing individual freedom, entrepreneurship and flexible labor markets.</li>
                <li><strong>The Christian Democrats (KD):</strong> Center-right party emphasizing family values and social responsibility, sometimes more willing than M and L to support labor market regulations.</li>
                <li><strong>The Sweden Democrats (SD):</strong> Nationalist party supporting the government externally, focuses on immigration restriction and "law and order".</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>On labor market issues, M and L have historically been clearly market-liberal, while KD has shown greater ambivalence. KD's Christian Democratic ideology emphasizes <em>"solidarity"</em> and <em>"subsidiarity"</em> — the idea that society has responsibility to protect vulnerable groups, but solutions should preferably come from civil society and social partners rather than the state.</p>
            
            <p>In practice, this means KD often finds itself between Social Democratic regulation and Liberal deregulation. In the interpellation debates, this was clear: Erik Slottner (KD) acknowledged problems but avoided specific commitments, while Johan Britz (L) was more categorically cautious.</p>
            
            <h3>The Coalition Agreement and Labor Market Policy</h3>
            
            <p>The government's coalition agreement, negotiated after the 2022 election, contains limited commitments on labor market regulation. Key points:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Preserve and strengthen the Swedish model":</strong> Vaguely worded promise to respect the collective agreement system.</li>
                <li><strong>"Combat unscrupulous actors":</strong> Increased resources to the Work Environment Authority and tax authorities to combat undeclared work and exploitation.</li>
                <li><strong>"Flexibility for businesses":</strong> Resistance to "over-regulation" of the labor market.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These formulations give the government room to maneuver but also create tensions. When EU directives force Sweden to act (as with the Platform Work Directive), the government must balance coalition partners with different ideological priorities.</p>

            <h2>What Happened Since? Retrospective February 2026</h2>
            
            <p>Seventeen months after these debates, and with the EU's implementation deadline for the Platform Work Directive recently passed (December 2025), we can evaluate how the government handled these challenges:</p>
            
            <h3>1. The EU Directive: Government Forced to Act</h3>
            
            <p>As predicted, Sweden had no option to ignore the EU's Platform Work Directive. During spring and summer 2025, the government presented its implementation bill — a compromise solution that introduced a <em>limited</em> presumption of employment.</p>
            
            <p>The legislation, which took effect in December 2025, meets EU minimum requirements but gives platform companies considerable room to maneuver by setting high thresholds for when the presumption is triggered. LO (Swedish Trade Union Confederation) and the Social Democrats criticized the implementation as "minimalist," while the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise praised it as "balanced."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Results so far:</strong> Few gig workers have been reclassified as employees. The debate continues about whether Sweden's implementation is sufficient to meet the European Commission's requirements. With the September 2026 general election, the Social Democrats have made this a campaign issue: promises to "strengthen" implementation if they regain power.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Subcontractor Chains: Status Quo Remains</h3>
            
            <p>As Minister Slottner's response suggested, the government has avoided hard statutory limits on subcontractor chains. Instead, focus has been on:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased inspections:</strong> The Work Environment Authority and tax authorities received expanded resources during 2025.</li>
                <li><strong>Voluntary industry agreements:</strong> The Swedish Construction Federation and some unions have signed recommendations on transparency.</li>
                <li><strong>Pilot projects:</strong> Some municipalities are testing limits in public procurement, but without national legislation.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The construction industry's exploitation problems persist, however, according to union reports from early 2026. This is expected to be a campaign issue, with the Social Democrats and Left Party promising Norwegian-style limits.</p>
            
            <h3>3. The 2026 Campaign: Worker Protection as Battleground</h3>
            
            <p>With just seven months to the general election, these interpellations from September 2024 have proven to be harbingers of a central campaign issue: <em>"Who protects workers in the modern economy?"</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>Social Democrats' position:</strong> Criticism of the government's "minimalist" implementation of the EU directive, promises of strengthened legislation and Norwegian-style limits on subcontractor chains.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Government's position:</strong> Defense of "balanced" strategy that protects workers without stifling innovation. Emphasizes increased inspections and voluntary solutions over "bureaucratic over-regulation."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sweden Democrats' role:</strong> Continued ambivalence. SD's focus on "law and order" could motivate support for stricter regulation of subcontractor chains, but coalition loyalty has so far weighed heavier.</p>
            
            <h3>4. International Context: Sweden Lagging Behind</h3>
            
            <p>The comparison with Denmark and Norway that Eva Lindh made in September 2024 has become even more relevant. Denmark reports (January 2026) that over 15,000 gig workers have been reclassified as employees since implementation. Sweden's figures are a fraction of this.</p>
            
            <p>Norway has also expanded its subcontractor chain limits to more sectors beyond construction, based on positive evaluations.</p>
            
            <p>The question for Swedish voters in September 2026: Should Sweden follow the Nordic trend toward stronger worker protections, or continue the current course?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: From Interpellation to Campaign Issue</h2>
            
            <p>The interpellation debates between Eva Lindh and ministers Johan Britz and Erik Slottner in September 2024 crystallized a deeper struggle over Swedish labor market policy that now, seventeen months later, stands at the center of the 2026 election campaign.</p>
            
            <p>On one side stands Social Democratic tradition — strong union power, collective agreements, statutory minimum standards. On the other stands the center-right vision — flexibility, entrepreneurship, minimal state intervention.</p>
            
            <p>The modern economy — with gig work, digital platforms and global supply chains — continues to challenge both paradigms. Old tools (collective agreements, Work Environment Authority inspections) struggle to handle new realities (algorithmic control, transnational subcontractor chains).</p>
            
            <p>The government's implementation of the EU's Platform Work Directive during 2025 — which Eva Lindh's interpellation predicted would be controversial — has become a campaign issue. The Social Democrats argue the implementation was insufficient and promise to strengthen it. The government defends its "balanced" strategy.</p>
            
            <p>The question of subcontractor chains, where the government chose not to follow the Norwegian model despite Lindh's pressure, remains unresolved and also constitutes a potential battleground.</p>
            
            <p>For millions of workers — from Foodora cyclists to construction workers — the stakes are high when Sweden goes to the polls in September 2026. These interpellations from September 2024 proved to be harbingers of a central ideological dividing line in the election campaign.</p>
